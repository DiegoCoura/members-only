## About the Project

This is a Node/Express server-side rendering project and the goal of Members-Only is to allow only authorized people to interact, for this purpose this project has an authentication system made with passportJs. The form validation was made using express-validator, and all the data is stored in a postgresql database hosted on railway. For the Interfaces I used Ejs template engine and css.

With passport and express-session I was able to handle clients sessions, also bcrypt to handle passwords utilities. 

Deal with timezone differences was quite challenging, to avoid pollute the UI with a dropdown menu where the user should choose the timezone, I had to use geoip-lite and request-ip to track down the clients timezones.
