Members-Only is a message board where only true friends can send messages, delete their own messages and discover who the authors are.

## About the Project

This is a Node/Express server-side rendering project, and the goal of Members-Only is to allow only authorized people to interact. For this purpose, the project includes an authentication system made with PassportJS. Form validation was implemented using express-validator, and all the data is stored in a PostgreSQL database hosted on Railway. For the interfaces, I used the EJS template engine and CSS.

With Passport and express-session, I was able to manage client sessions, and used bcrypt for password utilities.

Dealing with timezone differences was quite challenging. To avoid polluting the UI with a dropdown menu where the user would choose the timezone, I had to use geoip-lite and request-ip to track the clients' timezones.
